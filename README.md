Backend -repo (https://github.com/RedGh0st1/Portfolio-project---backend/blob/main/README.md)

##Application Description 

        GigA is a personal gaming archive. It was meant to track and locate each gaming system and video games you have presently at home. It built this skeleton application because my kids keep on losing their video games and would say i never  bought them the game. So this application should be able to tell if you have the game physcial or digital. What i learn from building this application is i need to start small and simple instead of going for the glory. So will be over time updating and adding more features to this application. The main goal is to make it accessible for all. Open Source

### Additional
 I would like to slowly update this application bi-weekly or once a month with more features. So i can allow this appliation to grow. I want make this application to be as open source as possible to ui/ux ideas to additional Features. So below, I will list once a month or twice a month features that i have added and the date it was completed so you can update your application. Suggesting is always accepted because growth only comes with a community. I want people to download learn and benefit from it especially parents with kids.
